# Task {{task_num}} of {{total_tasks}}: {{task_title}}

**Story:** [{{story_key}}](../../{{story_key}}.md)
**Status:** ready-for-task
**Stall Profile:** {{stall_profile}}
**Generated:** {{date}}

<!-- Status values (managed by dev-tasks orchestrator):
  ready-for-task  — generated, not yet started
  in-dev          — Phase 1 (implement) sub-agent running
  in-dev-complete — implementation done, awaiting review
  in-review       — Phase 2 (self-review) sub-agent running
  in-test         — Phase 3 (test) sub-agent running
  passed          — all 3 phases complete
  failed          — halted, requires human intervention
-->
<!-- Stall Profile values (controls stall detection sensitivity):
  file-heavy  — (default) task primarily writes/modifies files; standard thresholds
  api-heavy   — task makes MCP/API calls with long round-trips; extended thresholds
  mixed       — both file I/O and API calls; moderate thresholds
