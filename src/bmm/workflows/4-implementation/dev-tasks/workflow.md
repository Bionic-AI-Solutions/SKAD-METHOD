# Dev Tasks Workflow

**Goal:** Orchestrate atomic task-level implementation across tasks, stories, and epics using a 3-phase pipeline per task: Implement → Review → Test. Advance automatically through tasks and stories; halt at configurable checkpoints for human sign-off.

**Your Role:** Orchestrator. You do not write production code directly. You spawn and monitor sub-agents, read state from task files and sprint-status, and advance the pipeline.

- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} tailored to {user_skill_level}
- Execute ALL steps in exact order; do NOT skip steps
- NEVER advance to the next task until the current task has `passed` status
- NEVER modify test assertions to make a test pass — only production code is fixed
- Read state from files at the start of every iteration — never assume state from memory

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-tasks`
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `story_path` = `` (explicit story path; auto-discovered if empty)

### OpenProject Integration

Read `openproject_id` from config (may be null if OP not configured).

- `op_sync_workflow` = `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/openproject-sync/workflow.md`
- `op_map_file` = `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/openproject-map.yaml`
- `op_enabled` = true if `openproject_id` is present AND `op_map_file` exists, else false

If `op_enabled` is false: all OP sync steps in this workflow are silently skipped.

### Autonomy Mode

Read `autonomy_mode` from config or user invocation argument. Valid values:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `implement-only` | Run Phase 1 (implement) only per task; no auto review/test |
| `halt-after-story` | **(Default)** Pause after all tasks in a story are passed, awaiting human approval before advancing |
| `halt-on-high` | Pause only when Phase 2 review finds a High-severity issue |
| `full-hands-off` | Run to completion (or failure) without pausing |

If `autonomy_mode` is not set, default to `halt-after-story`.

### Stall Detection Settings

Base thresholds (adjusted per task `Stall Profile`):

| Stall Profile | `stall_warn` | `stall_kill` | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `file-heavy` (default) | 10 min | 20 min | Code writing, unit tests — frequent file writes expected |
| `api-heavy` | 20 min | 40 min | MCP calls, API integrations, infra validation — long periods without file I/O |
| `mixed` | 15 min | 30 min | Both file writes and API calls |

Config overrides (`stall_warn_minutes`, `stall_kill_minutes`) take precedence over profile defaults.

### Multi-Signal Activity Detection

A sub-agent is considered **alive** if ANY of these signals are true:

| Signal | What It Detects | How to Check |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **TaskOutput growth** | Agent produced new output (tool results, text) | `TaskOutput(agent_id)` length increased since last poll |
| **Active child processes** | Agent is running tools (curl, python3, node, etc.) | `pgrep -P <agent_pid> -la` returns active children |
| **Network socket activity** | Agent is making API/MCP calls | `ss -tnp \| grep -c <agent_pid>` shows established connections |

The orchestrator only declares a stall when **ALL signals are negative** for the full `stall_kill` duration.

Override base thresholds via config or invocation args if needed.

      You are performing a focused self-review of a just-implemented task. Your job is to verify correctness and quality.

      Task file: {{current_task_file}}

      Review against the task file's Completion Checklist:
      - Are ALL checklist items satisfied? (verify each one independently)
      - Do the modified files match ONLY the 'Exact Files to Touch' list?
      - Does the implementation satisfy the stated acceptance criteria references?
      - Are there any DO NOT violations?
      - Is there any dead code, debug output, or commented-out test logic?

      For each finding, classify severity:
        - High: correctness bug, AC not met, test integrity violation (test modified to pass instead of fixing code)
        - Medium: code quality, missing edge case, minor deviation from task spec
        - Low: style, naming, comment quality

## Task Status Reference

Task files use the `Status:` field to track pipeline phase. Valid values:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `ready-for-task` | Task generated, not yet started |
| `in-dev` | Phase 1 (implement) sub-agent running |
| `in-dev-complete` | Implementation done, awaiting review phase |
| `in-review` | Phase 2 (review) sub-agent running |
| `in-test` | Phase 3 (test) sub-agent running |
| `passed` | All 3 phases complete — task is done |
| `failed` | Halted due to unresolvable failure — requires human intervention |

---

## Stall Detection Reference

### Multi-Signal Activity Detection

The orchestrator polls sub-agent health every `effective_stall_warn` minutes using three independent signals:

| Signal | Command | What it catches |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **TaskOutput growth** | `TaskOutput(agent_id)` length delta | Agent producing any output (tool calls, text, errors) |
| **Active child processes** | `pgrep -la "curl\|python3\|node\|pytest\|jest"` | Agent running tools, test suites, API calls |
| **Network socket activity** | `ss -tnp \| grep -c "ESTAB"` | Active TCP connections (MCP calls, HTTP APIs) |

A stall is declared **only when ALL THREE signals are negative** for the full `effective_stall_kill` duration. Any single positive signal resets the stall timer.

### Stall Profile Thresholds

Each task file declares a `Stall Profile:` field that adjusts detection sensitivity:

| Profile | `stall_warn` | `stall_kill` | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `file-heavy` | 10 min | 20 min | Code writing, unit tests — frequent file writes expected |
| `api-heavy` | 20 min | 40 min | MCP calls, API integrations, infra validation — long periods without file I/O |
| `mixed` | 15 min | 30 min | Both file writes and API calls |

Config overrides (`stall_warn_minutes`, `stall_kill_minutes`) always take precedence over profile defaults.

### Recovery Sequence

When a stall is confirmed (all signals negative for `stall_kill` duration):

1. `TaskStop(agent_id)` — kill stalled agent
2. `git status` — identify uncommitted partial changes
3. `git stash "dev-tasks recovery: stalled on <task>"` — stash partial state
4. Spawn fresh sub-agent with Recovery Context describing the stash and last known point
5. Track retry count — HALT after 2 failed retries

### Why Not CPU/Memory?

**CPU** is unreliable as a stall signal: the sub-agent's process spends most of its time waiting on Anthropic's inference API (near-zero CPU) even while actively reasoning. CPU spikes only during tool execution — the same pattern as a sleeping process that wakes briefly. False negatives make it unsuitable as a primary signal.

**Memory** is not useful: agent RSS stays roughly constant once loaded. A stalled agent and an active agent are indistinguishable by memory footprint.

---

## Autonomy Mode Configuration

Set `autonomy_mode` in `{project-root}/_skad/bmm/config.yaml`:

```yaml
autonomy_mode: halt-after-story  # implement-only | halt-after-story | halt-on-high | full-hands-off
stall_warn_minutes: 10
stall_kill_minutes: 20
```

Or override at invocation time: `dev-tasks autonomy_mode=full-hands-off`

---

## Test Integrity Principle

> **Tests are the source of truth. They define what the code must do.**

If a verification command fails, the orchestrator and all sub-agents MUST:
- Diagnose the root cause in production code
- Fix production code only
- Re-run the command to confirm the fix

If fixing production code appears to require changing a test assertion, this is a signal that either:
1. The implementation fundamentally misunderstands the acceptance criterion (fix the implementation)
2. The test was authored incorrectly in `create-tasks` (escalate to human — do not auto-fix)

The orchestrator will HALT and surface a `TEST-INTEGRITY-HALT` when this situation is detected.
